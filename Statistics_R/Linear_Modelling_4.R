## **Checking of Assumptions for Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression**

#-----------------------------(F2-F1)-------------------------------------------

# The **diagnostic plots** show residuals in four different ways
# (http://www.sthda.com/english/articles/39-regression-model-diagnostics/161-linear-regression-assumptions-and-diagnostics-in-r-essentials/)):
# 1. Residuals vs Fitted. The predicted Y-values ($\hat{y}$) are on the X-axis, and the residuals (*e*) are
# on the Y-axis. Used to check the linear relationship assumptions. A horizontal line, without distinct
# patterns is an indication for a linear relationship.
# 2. Normal Q-Q. The ordered observed standardised residuals are on the Y-axis, and the ordered theoretical
# residuals (expected residuals if they are truly normally distributed) are on the X-axis. Used to examine
# whether the residuals are normally distributed. Itâ€™s good if residuals points follow the straight dashed
# line.
# 3. Scale-Location (or Spread-Location). Used to check the homogeneity of variance of the residuals
# (homoscedasticity). Horizontal line with equally spread points is a good indication of homoscedasticity.
# 4. Residuals vs Leverage. Used to identify influential cases, that is extreme values that might influence
# the regression results when included or excluded from the analysis. This plot will be described further
# in the next sections.
# The four plots show the top 3 most extreme data points labeled with the row numbers of the data in the
# data set. They might be potentially problematic.

### 1. Unusual Observations
# Unusual observations may disproportionately influence the outcomes of the models.
# OLS regression is not very robust against these types of observations.
# In  the  absence  of  outliers  and  with  the  fulfillment  of  the  assumptions  of  zero mean,
# constant variance, and uncorrelated errors the OLS provides the Best Linear Unbiased Estimators (BLUE)
# of the regression parameters. But any anomalous point can disproportionately pull the line and distort
# the predictions. Detection of outlying observations is a very  essential  part  of  good  regression 
# analysis. I will not remove outliers unless they are obvious errors (e.g., 44 on a 1 - 5 scale).

# An influential observation is one which either individually or together with several other observations
# has a demonstrably larger impact on the calculated values of various estimates (e.g., coefficient,
# standard errors, t-values) than to the case for most of the other observation (Belsley et al., 1980).

#### 1.1 Outliers
# An outlier is an observation with a large (absolute) residual. Outliers can be identified by examining
# the standardized residual, which is the residual divided by its estimated standard error. Standardized
# residuals can be interpreted as the number of standard errors away from the regression line. Observations
# whose standardized residuals are greater than 3 in absolute value are possible outliers
# (James et al. 2014). It would be expected that only 0.2% of observations would fall into this category.
d <- cooks.distance(full.modelF2F1) # COOK'S DISTANCE
r <- stdres(full.modelF2F1) # STANDARDIZED RESIDUALS
rabs <- abs(r) # absolute stand. resid.
a <- cbind(dataF2F1[,-c(1:19)], d, r, rabs)
asorted <- a[order(-rabs), ]
absresids <- asorted[1:10, ]
kable(absresids, "html") %>% kable_styling("striped") %>% scroll_box(width = "100%")
# The table shows the 10 highest absolute values of the standardized residuals (rabs). Three such residuals
# are larger than 3, subject 261, 246, and 191. On of these subjects, sub-261, is identified as an outlier
# by an outlier test below.

# TEST FOR OUTLIERS. Bonferroni outlier test
outlierTest(full.modelF2F1) # sub-010261


#### 1.2 Influential Observations
# Cook's Distance (d). Cut-off points of *4/n*. 
# Cook's distance refers to how far, on average, predicted y-values will move if the observation in
# question is dropped from the data set. It is a measure that combines the information of leverage and the
# residual of the observation. 14 observations have values of Cook's D above 4/N = 0.019.
kable(a[d > 4/N, ], "html") %>% kable_styling("striped") %>% scroll_box(width = "100%")

#### 1.3 High leverage observations
# Possible high leverage observations are shown in the **Residuals vs Leverage plot**:
plot(full.modelF2F1, 5)
# A data point has high leverage if it has extreme predictor x values. This can be detected by examining
# the leverage statistic, or the hat-values, which are the diagonal elements of the hat-matrix and which
# describe the leverage each point has on its fitted values. A value of this statistic above 2(p + 1)/n
# indicates an observation with high leverage (P. Bruce and Bruce 2017); where, p is the number of
# predictors and n is the number of observations. Three observations are identified as having high
# leverage (.hat > 2(p+1)/n)

# Create table of model metrics and identify observations with high leverage
model.metrics.F2F1 <- data.frame(augment(full.modelF2F1))
row.names(model.metrics.F2F1) <- model.metrics.F2F1[,1]
model.metrics.F2F1 <- model.metrics.F2F1[, -c(1:19)]
p <- ncol(dataF2F1)
n <- nrow(dataF2F1)
hlt.F2F1 <- 2 * (p + 1) / n # high-leverage threshold
model.metrics.F2F1[model.metrics.F2F1$.hat > hlt.F2F1,]


### 2. Residuals are Normaly Distributed

# The distribution of the residuals can be visualized with a histogram. It appears slightly skewed.
resid.modelF2F1 <- residuals(full.modelF2F1)
hist(resid.modelF2F1)

# The **Q-Q plot** of residuals can be used to inspect the normality assumption. Some observations fall
# outside of the reference line.
plot(full.modelF2F1, 2)

# Due to the large sample size, a normality test should be able to provide more information. The
# *Shaprio-Wilks test* indicate that residuals are not normally distributed. The *Anderson-Darling* test,
# which is generally considered better than the Shaprio-Wilks, does not reject the null hypothesis of
# normally distributed residuals for the model, but with p = 0.052.
shapiro.test(resid.modelF2F1)
ad.test(resid.modelF2F1)

# The central limit theorem will make the coefficients asymptotically normal, even if the errors are not.
# However, the speed of this asymptotic convergence greatly depends on how non-normal the distribution
# of the errors is. The histogram and the Q-Q plot both indicate that there is no large deviation from the
# assumption of normality, rather a small amount of outliers that appear to be causing some problems.
# Non-severe departures from normality yield valid (asymptotic) inference for relatively large sample
# sizes, which is one reason why this assumption is generally considered less problematic than the other
# assumptions. See e.g., https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.23.100901.140546.

### 3. Homoscedasticity
# This assumption states that the variance of error terms are similar across the values of the independent
# variables. A **scale-location** plot of standardized residuals versus predicted values can show whether
# points are equally distributed across all values of the independent variables.
# The red line is fairly horizontal and there is no clear pattern, which is what we want.
plot(full.modelF2F1, 3)

#### 3.1 Studentized Breusch-Pagan (BP) test for heteroscedasticity.
# The Breush-Pagan test can be used to test for heteroscedasticity. It tests whether the variance of the
# errors from a regression is dependent on the values of the independent variables. In that case,
# heteroscedasticity is present. Similar to the scale-location plot, It does not indicate heteroscedasticity. 
bp <- bptest(full.modelF2F1, studentize = TRUE) # looks good
bp

### 4. Linear Relationship Between the Dependent Variable (FAA) and the Independent Variables

#### 4.1 Residuals vs fitted plot
# There should be no pattern in the **residual plot**. Ideally, the red line should be approximately flat
# and the points scattered completely random. This line indicates a slight negative slope, but no clear
# non-linear pattern is visible.
plot(full.modelF2F1, 1)

### 5. No Multicollinearity
# The correlation matrices showed low correlations between the independent variables. Variance Inflation
# Factor (VIF) test shows the same, no collinearity (< 2.5 is very low).
# VARIANCE INFLATION FACTOR (VIF)
car::vif(full.modelF2F1)

# For model F2-F1, the biggest problem is the possible violation of the assumption of normality of
# residuals, although this was only indicated by one of the two tests. This is the least severe assumption
# to violate, as the linear model will still be the BLUE (if other assumptions hold), but inference will
# be incorrect due to biased standard errors. As mentioned above, the central limit theorem will make the
# coefficients asymptotically normal (https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.publhealth.23.100901.140546).

# Overall, there are no major departures from the assumptions. We also have a fairly large sample (N>200),
# and N is large enough, the sampling distribution will be approximately normal because of the Central
# Limit Theorem (CLT). Furthermore, I wish to stay within the linear model framework, as opposed to e.g.,
# transforming certain variables, as this is both the most common practice in behavioural sciences and
# provide easily interpretable results. This is important since the aim of this analysis is to explain the
# relationship between FAA and various personality variables, as opposed to predict prediction
# (see e.g., doi.org/10.1214/10-STS330).

# At the end, under EXTRA, I also estimate standard errors of the coefficients and confidence intervals
# empirically with non-parametric bootstrap, as a way to deal with possible bias in these measures. This
# relaxes the assumptions of residuals being a certain distribution (i.e., normal). See e.g., Pek et al.,
# 2018 and https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brat.2017.05.013 for more information. I do this simply for the
# purpose of comparison. If these bootstrapped estimates deviate notably from the once derived by the OLS
# models above, there could be some problems with my models. These estimates are not reported in the thesis.
